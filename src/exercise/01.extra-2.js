/* SH Notes 01.extra-2.js:
		changes API again. Now back to passing in the new state, like we did in 01.js.
		except this time state is an object. (extra-1 had us calculate state within
		the reducer; we instead passed in the data required to calculate the new state)
		That evidentally was a temp diversion.

		A different interpretation of the new API is that we are passing in only the
		properties on state that we want changed. Since there is only 1 property, it
		is inclear if the exercise is guiding us toward passing the new state as a
		whole, or the new values for properties that we want updated on the state
		object.

		So I have both versions (one commented out) in my code.

		It would be awesome if the instructions hinted at the goal we are reaching
		for, and hence would better guide how we should tailor our reducer function.
		(It matters for param naming, and for the format we settle on for how we
		compute the returned state object, so the proper use case is accounted for,
		without unnecessary code complexity. -- though I TEND togo for the more
		complex version to cover more cases, I see that Dodds & other pros TEND to
		prefer minimal, but complete for the use case. I tend toward risk adverse
		that could prevent future errors in the case of refactoring beyond the init
		usage.
		For example: in Hooks module, I PREFER .then.catch. He prefers (success, failure))
		Of course I worry that some later re-write might add code besides a setState
		call, that introduce an error. If that were to happen, the error might not
		be caught appropriately. But I guess, it is dumb to think the fetch function
		would ever be re-written to include any code other than setState. And they
		have the foresight to KNOW that. BTW, I updated my code to follow THEIR lead.
		But, I prefer to have the safer default to be my HABIT. Otherwise, I forget
		when those edge cases might arise, and can produce a difficult to find bug.

/* Instructions 01.extra-2.js | useReducer:
		### 2. üíØ simulate setState with an object

		[Production deploy](https://advanced-react-hooks.netlify.com/isolated/final/01.extra-2.js)

		Remember `this.setState` from class components? If not, lucky you üòâ.
		Either way, let's see if you can figure out how to make the state updater
		(`dispatch` function) behave in a similar way by changing our `state` to an
		object (`{count: 0}`)
		and then calling the state updater with an object
		merges with the current state.

		So here's how I want things to look now:

			```javascript
			const [state, setState] = React.useReducer(countReducer, {
				count: initialCount,
			})
			const {count} = state
			const increment = () => setState({count: count + step})
			```

		How would you need to change the reducer to make this work?

 */
/* Instructions 01.extra-1.js | useReducer: use step as the action arg
		1. üíØ accept the step as the action

		This one is just to show that you can pass anything as the action.

		I want to change things a bit to have this API:

		const [count, changeCount] = React.useReducer(countReducer, initialCount)
		const increment = () => changeCount(step)
		How would you need to change your reducer to make this work?

/* Instructions 01.js | useReducer: vs useState
		Replace useState hook with useReducer hook.
		You'll need to write a countReducer function to pass into the useReducer hook.
		It's first parameter must be state.
		You'll want its second parameter to be the new state value, so we can keep the
			same API that useState has.
			This will allow us to not have to change the any of the code that formerly
			used useState (our component invocations), once we replace it with useReducer
		Its return value should be the new state, ie the new value of the counter.

/* SH Notes 01.js:
// reducer (state, optionalUserParam1, optionalUserParam2, ...)
//  Whatever funtion we pass in to our useReducer Hook,
//  Must always take state (the current, soon to be "prev" value)
//    as the first parameter.
//  (after that, we can add on any number of OUR params, including nothing else)
//  BUT, when we CALL our reducer via the function returned from useReducer,
//    we only call it with OUR Parameters.
//    React supplies the at-that-time current value of state.
//
//  As 01.md puts it:
//   One important thing to note here is that the reducer (eg nameReducer)
//     is called with two arguments:
//    - the current state
//    - whatever it is that the dispatch function (eg setName) is called with.
//      This is often called an ‚Äúaction.‚Äù
